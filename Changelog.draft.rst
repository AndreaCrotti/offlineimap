`WIP (coming releases)`
=======================

New Features
------------

* When a message upload/download fails, we do not abort the whole folder
  synchronization, but only skip that message, informing the user at the
  end of the sync run.
 
* Implement per-account locking, so that it will possible to sync
  different accounts at the same time. The old global lock is still in
  place for backward compatibility reasons (to be able to run old and
  new versions of OfflineImap concurrently) and will be removed in the
  future. Starting with this version, OfflineImap will be
  forward-compatible with the per-account locking style.

Changes
-------

* Refactor our IMAPServer class. Background work without user-visible
  changes.
* Remove the configurability of the Blinkenlights statuschar. It
  cluttered the main configuration file for little gain.
* Updated bundled imaplib2 to version 2.28.
* Maildir repositories now also respond to folderfilter= configurations.

Bug Fixes
---------

* We protect more robustly against asking for inexistent messages from the
  IMAP server, when someone else deletes or moves messages while we sync.
* Selecting inexistent folders specified in folderincludes now throws
  nice errors and continues to sync with all other folders rather than
  exiting offlineimap with a traceback.

Pending for the next major release
==================================

* UIs get shorter and nicer names. (API changing)
